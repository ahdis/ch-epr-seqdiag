# SWISS EPR sequence diagrams
The purpose of this sequence is to provide the basis for a common understanding of the [Swiss EPR](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/en/electronic-patient-record.html) specifications.
A review of the specifications listed below was done with the focus on understanding the interactions between different actors taking part to the EPR. 
The outcome is a set of Sequence Diagrams. Each sequence diagram describes a subset of the exchange of information between the participating actors. 
The sequence diagram have been finalized in Bern in 2017 during a workshop with eHealth Suisse, MOFH and IHE Services and were used to develop
the test diagrams in [gazelle](https://ehealthsuisse.ihe-europe.net/gazelle/home.seam). See [changes](changs.md) for latest updates, the sequence diagrams are kept in sync.
