# SWISS EPR sequence diagrams
The purpose of this sequence is to provide the basis for a common understanding of the [Swiss EPR](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/en/electronic-patient-record.html) specifications.
A review of the specifications listed below was done with the focus on understanding the interactions between different actors taking part to the EPR. 
The outcome is a set of Sequence Diagrams. Each sequence diagram describes a subset of the exchange of information between the participating actors. 
The sequence diagram have been finalized in Bern in 2017 during a workshop with eHealth Suisse, MOFH and IHE Services and were used to develop
the test diagrams in [gazelle](https://ehealthsuisse.ihe-europe.net/gazelle/home.seam). See [changes](changes.md) for latest updates, the sequence diagrams are kept in sync.

## specifications
Updated specifications for the next Swiss #EPR #projectathon in Bern September 2018, check [eHealth Suisse Relevant Specification]( https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/gemeinschaften-umsetzung/umsetzung/programmierhilfen/relevante-spezifikationen.html) and [overview](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/Dokumente/2018/E/180220_Grafik_Swiss_Electronic_Patient_Record_v1.4_e.pdf)
